# Changelog

## 0.3.0

- **Follow My Slides** (the ⟳ button or **⌃⌥F**): the notes move with your presentation on their own.
  - **Keynote and PowerPoint:** exact. SpeakerNotes asks the app which slide is showing, even during a full-screen slideshow. Numbered headings in your notes (`## 7. Pricing`) are matched by number.
  - **Google Slides, Canva, PDFs and other apps:** SpeakerNotes reads the slide's title with Apple's on-device text recognition and moves to the notes slide with that title, only when the match is clear and two readings agree. On macOS 26 with Apple Intelligence, titles that don't match word for word are matched by meaning.
  - Moving by hand pauses following for a few seconds. Call apps like Zoom are ignored.
- **Import Notes from Keynote or PowerPoint** (File menu, or the welcome screen): turns the open deck's presenter notes into a notes file, one numbered heading per slide, and starts following.
- macOS asks once for Automation (Keynote, PowerPoint) and Screen Recording (other apps) when you first use these.

## 0.2.1

- SpeakerNotes now lives in [applied-ai-agents](https://github.com/roy-vinay/applied-ai-agents/tree/main/tools/speakernotes), next to Tech60. The install command, **Check for Updates** and downloads point there. Your notes and settings are kept.

## 0.2.0

- **New look:** a dark, translucent window with no title bar clutter. The header has a slide picker (click **2 / 12** to jump to any slide) and buttons for text, emphasis, opening and editing. The footer has previous and next, a progress bar you can click to jump, and the teleprompter controls.
- **Easy to open notes:** when nothing is open, the window offers **Open Notes…**, **Write Notes** and your recent files. **File > Open Recent** and the Dock icon's menu list them too.
- **Always easy to launch:** SpeakerNotes now has a Dock icon and a full menu bar. Clicking the Dock icon always brings the notes back, **SpeakerNotes > Open at Login** starts it with your Mac, and it reopens on the same file and slide. If a display is unplugged mid-talk, the window moves back onto a screen you can see (**View > Reset Window Position** does it by hand).
- **Text settings (Aa):** size, typeface (System, Rounded, Serif, Mono) and line spacing.
- **Emphasis:** highlight, bold, color or underline any phrase everywhere it appears. Select text and right-click, write `==text==` in your notes, or describe it in the Emphasize panel. Emphasis is saved per file and never changes the file itself.
- **Instructions with on-device AI:** on macOS 26 with Apple Intelligence, type something like "highlight the parts of an agent" and Apple's on-device model finds them on every slide. Your notes never leave your Mac. On other Macs, the panel highlights the exact phrase you type.
- Small messages confirm changes ("Saved", "Text 24 pt"), and click-through shows an amber border so you always know it's on.

## 0.1.0

- **Floating notes window** that stays on top of every app, including full-screen slides. Move it and resize it anywhere; it remembers where you left it.
- **Stays out of your screen share and recordings** where macOS allows it. Turn this off from the menu bar if you want viewers to see it.
- **Never steals focus:** click your slides behind it to change them. The notes stay put.
- **Per-slide notes:** separate slides with a line of `---` (or use `#` and `##` headings). **⌃⌥→** and **⌃⌥←** move between them from any app.
- **Move with My Slide Keys** (optional): when you press → or ← in your slides, the notes follow. Needs Accessibility permission.
- **Teleprompter:** **⌃⌥Space** starts or stops auto-scroll, **⌃⌥↑** and **⌃⌥↓** change the speed.
- **Click-through:** **⌃⌥T** lets clicks pass through the window to what's under it.
- **Markdown files:** open with **⌘O**, drop a file on the window, or use Open With in Finder. Headings, bullets, numbered lists, bold, italic and code are shown clearly. The notes reload when you edit the file in another app.
- **Edit in place:** **⌘E** switches between editing and presenting; edits save back to the file.
- Text size (**⌘+ / ⌘−**) and see-through (**⌘] / ⌘[**).
